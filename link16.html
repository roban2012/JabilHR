第五节：培训和发展<br><br>

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT<br><br>

培训是公司各项运作获得成功的关键一环。适当的和有记录的培训为有效的运作，优异的产品质量，最高的顾客满意度和员工发展所必需。<br><br>
Training is one of the keys to success of any operation in the company. Appropriate and documented training is a necessity for efficient process, highest quality, greatest customer satisfaction, and employee development.<br><br>
有效的培训是每一位部门经理和主管的职责。培训的主要方式是以在职培训为主，辅以必要的课堂培训和外部培训。<br><br>
Effective training is the responsibility of the managers/supervisors of each of the departments. The primary mode of training is through on-the-job training (OJT), supplemented by formal classroom and outside training, as required.<br><br>
5.1 概述 <br><br>
General Brief<br><br>
所有员工在履行其所分派的工作前，都应参加入职培训/捷普化培训和其它工作所需的培训。<br><br>
All employees are required to receive training identified as Orientation/Jabilization and any required Job Specific Training prior to performing any work in their job assignments.<br><br>
在人力资源部培训组的协助下，部门经理和主管应决定各个职位为成功地履行工作职责所必需的各项培训，并确保各员工按计划接受培训。<br><br>

Managers and supervisors, with assistance from the Training Section of HR Department, must determine what training is
required for successful performance and insure that all employees receive the training in a timely manner.<br><br>
为确保生产线员工的技能和工作表现符合生产和质量的要求，生产线员工必须定期接受再培训和再认证。<br><br>
Production personnel must be retrained and/or re-certified on a scheduled basis to assure skills and performances meet production and quality standards.<br><br>
5.2 入职培训/捷普化培训 <br><br>
Orientation/Jabilization<br><br>
为使员工了解公司、公司架构和品质要求，每一个员工都被要求参加以下入职培训课程，该课程包括了以下核心内容：<br><br>
In order to provide employees with knowledge about the company, its structure and the quality requirements etc, all
employees will be required to join the orientation program which includes the following core contents:<br><br>
公司历史/架构/政策<br><br>
Company History/Structure/Policy Overview<br><br>
Workcell 概念<br><br>
Workcell concept<br><br>
品质和环境政策<br><br>
Quality and Environment Policy<br><br>
静电防护培训<br><br>
ESD Training (Electro Static Discharge)<br><br>

捷普化培训是指新员工入职后的一系列的在职培训。捷普化培训应由员工所在部门的部门经理负责安排。<br><br>
Jabilization is similar to on-theCjob training, which should be provided to new hires right after one is on board and are responsible by the employees' functional manager.<br><br>
5.3 与职位相关的培训 <br><br>
Job- Based Training<br><br>
与职位相关的培训需求基于完成该职位的工作所要求技能，知识和能力而确定。<br><br>
Job-based training requirements for each employee are based on the skills, knowledge and ability levels appropriate to the job for which the person will be assigned.<br><br>
5.4 培训协议 <br><br>
Training Bond Agreement<br><br>
因员工工作和发展提升需要，公司会安排有潜力的员工参加专业技术培训，并就培训项目涉及的费用（包括但不仅限于员工参加培训/研究会/课程/系统或项目转移期间的课程费，交通，住宿，用餐和其它杂费）与员工签署培训协议，约定服务期。劳动合同期满，但服务期尚未到期的，公司有权按劳动合同期满终止劳动合同，公司未提出终止要求的，劳动合同自动续延至服务期满。<br><br>
Per job and career development needs, the potential employee will be arranged to attend professional technical training and required to sign a Training bond Agreement with the company for the training expense (including course fees, transportation, accommodation, meal expenses and incidental charge) & conclude a service period. In case that the employment contract was shorter than the bond service period, company has the right to terminate the contract as expiration. The employment contract will automated extend to the end date of service period if there were no request by company<br><br>
5.5 学习管理系统 <br><br>
Learning Management System<br><br>
学习管理系统是一项基于互联网的电子学习工具，它能够提供更结构化的培训方法达到以下目的：<br><br>
Learning Management System is a web-based e-learning tool developed to provide a more structured approach to education in order to:<br><br>
强化我们的核心文化 <br><br>
Enhance our core culture<br><br>
理解Workcell 模式<br><br>
Understand the Workcell model<br><br>
发展我们的管理人员<br><br>
Develop our leaders<br><br>
帮助我们的员工，以使员工可以在捷普独特的环境中获得成功。 <br><br>
Help our employees to succeed in our unique environment<br><br>

学习管理系统的课程提供多个培训模块，以使捷普之道逐渐融入捷普在全世界的各个角落。<br><br>

Learning Management System curriculum provides modules to ensure the Jabil way is instilled worldwide.<br><br>
5.6 员工教育资助计划 <br><br>
Employee Degree Program<br><br>
捷普根据教育资助计划为它的全职员工接受继续教育提供财务资助。<br><br>
Jabil provides educational assistance in the form of financial reimbursements to its identified, full time employees in accordance with the prevailing terms and conditions of the Degree Program.<br><br>
5.7 绩效评估<br><br>
Performance Review<br><br>
对员工的绩效进行评估是个持续不断的过程。绩效评估将给员工和他的主管或经理讨论员工的工作发展机会――既包括员工表现出色的方面，也包括员工需要改进的地方。<br><br>
绩效评估一般每年举行一次，在那个时候员工有可能获得薪资调整。薪资的调整幅度将根据员工的工作表现、市场薪资状况和公司的实际支付能力进行。评估将在全球绩效管理系统内由员工和他的直接主管或经理之间单独完成。员工及其经理可以在线评估评分和发表意见，电子签名确认年度绩效评估结果。历史评估结果可供追踪查询。<br><br>


The review of an employee's performance is an ongoing process. Performance reviews will provide an opportunity for the employee and his/her supervisor or manager to discuss the employees' progress-the areas in which an employee excels as well as areas where he/she may need to improve.<br><br>

Performance reviews are typically given once a year and employees may receive a salary adjustment at that time. The amount of salary adjustment will be based on employee's performance, market remuneration levels and the company actual pay ability. Reviews will be conducted between the employee and his/her immediate supervisor or manager through the GPMP (Global Performance Management Process). Employees and managers can input, review, rate and digitally sign annual performance appraisals online. The review result can be traceable.<br><br>


5.8 内部员工聘任计划<br><br>
Internal Opportunity Program (IOP)<br><br>
捷普希望员工所从事的工作能符合员工自身兴趣，并充分发挥其能力与技能，同时满足捷普的发展需要，公司鼓励内部提升。考虑到雇用有相关经验员工的客观性和合理性，尤其是在公司快速发展时期，在实际操作中，我们通过电子邮件公布内部空缺职位，当我们为某一职位确定合适人选时，会综合考虑内部候选人以前的工作表现、习惯、工作态度、工作经验、受训情况、出勤率、在捷普的工作年限及在现职位的工作年限等因素。<br><br>
Jabil hope its employees to have the job that best satisfy their abilities, interest and skills, as well as meet Jabil's development needs. It is Jabil's intention to promote from internal; however, the company must also recognize the logic and fairness of hiring persons with previous experience, particularly in times of rapid growth. When practical, openings for positions will be posted via e-mail, work performance, habit, attitude, previous experience, training, attendance record, time with Jabil and time in current position are the areas reviewed when selecting a candidate for the position.<br><br>
