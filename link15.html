<a href= "pic27.html">医疗期的计算及病假期间的工资发放比例</a>表格<br><br>

需要强调的是，上表中的根据实际工作年限和本公司工作年限划定的医疗期限，只是给员工享受医疗期的一种"资格"，但员工在某累计周期内是否能休满这种资格的医疗期，关键是视该员工是否确需停工治疗，如果在医疗期内病情相对稳定，则视为不需停工治疗，可进行医疗终结，不再享受医疗期，即使上表中的资格医疗期尚未休满。例：享受3个月医疗期的员工，如果从2009 年3 月5 日起第一次请病假（以公司认可的病假建议书为准），那么，一般情况下，该员工应在3 月5 日至9 月5 日之间累计病休3 个月即视为医疗期满，但若该员工在3 月30 日病情已相对稳定经诊断不需停工治疗的，那么医疗期于3 月30日终止。<br><br>
Above mentioned medical period based on the number of years the employee has actually worked and the number of years he or she has worked in Jabil is only an entitlement for sick leave.
