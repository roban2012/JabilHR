第六节：捷普集团商业行为与道德准则<br><br>

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics<br><br>
捷普电子作为原设备制造商提供先进电子制造服务的全球领先电子制造商，正努力促使公司员工、总监、董事皆正直诚实，品行端正没有缺失。虽然商界法律与惯例因地域而异，员工个性存在差异，但是无论业务做到哪里，我们都要遵循一定的标准和承担一定的责任。<br><br>
为此，我们制定了如下商业行为与道德准则，以帮助我们的员工解决工作当中可能碰到的商业道德问题。如有员工、总监或董事不能成功履行这些责任，或明知是不道德甚至犯罪的行为却仍然我行我素，公司将纠正其不良行为，采取的纠正措施包括终止雇佣合同及其与公司之间的其它关系，甚至按照以下纠正措施，使用法律手段或其他相应的修正手段。<br><br>
Jabil, a leading provider of advanced electronics manufacturing services (EMS) to OEMs, strives to ensure that the ethics and integrity of its employees, officers and board members are beyond reproach. Although business practices and laws vary from region to region, and each individual who works for Jabil is unique, we share certain standards and responsibilities wherever we do business.<br><br>


To this end, we have outlined the following Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to assist our staffs in resolving ethical questions that may arise in the course of their work for the company. If an employee, Director of Operations or board member fails to comply with these responsibilities, or fails to take corrective action, up to and including termination of employment or other relationship with the company and the company may pursue any legal or equitable remedies it may have, as further provided under ”Corrective Actions” below.<br><br>
6.1 总则 <br><br>
Overall<br><br>
本商业行为与道德准则没有也不可能涵盖所有方面，所以公司积极鼓励大家就任何道德上或法律上的疑问进行咨询。如果对最佳行为方式或对于某一状况的反应心存疑问，你可以联系营运总监，公司财务总裁或人力资源部经理。<br><br>
本商业行为与道德准则并不旨在取代比本准则更为严格的,在本准则中并未提及的当地政策及其所涉及到的话题，所有与本行为准则不符的其它同本条款相关的文件，均需以本行为准则为准。公司因诚实正直和信守商业道德而享有声誉不是理所当然的。要维持这一声誉，你必须在做每一个决定、每一个行动时发挥良好的判断力，它会影响你的工作成绩，影响其他员工或公司的合法经济利益。<br><br>
This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics does not and cannot cover every situation. The Company encourages you to seek guidance on any ethical or legal question. If you have any doubt about the best course of action or response to a situation, you should contact the Director of Operations, or the Financial Officer and Human Resource Manager.<br><br>

This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is not intended to supersede the more restrictive terms of any Local Rules or any topics that are covered in the Local Rules, but which are not covered by this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In the event of any other document related to issues herein, this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics shall govern.<br><br>
The company's reputation for integrity and business ethics should never be taken for granted. To maintain that reputation, you must exercise good judgment in your decisions and any conduct that affects your work performance, other employees, or the company's legitimate business interests.
<br><br>


6.2 避免利益冲突的商业标准<br><br>
Business Standards to Avoid Conflicts of Interest<br><br>
6.2.1 总则 <br><br>
GENERAL POLICY<br><br>
不得参与任何会导致与公司利益相冲突的事情。当你的利益与公司的利益发生冲突或可能会产生冲突时，这种冲突必须禁止。尽管这种义务可能并不会阻止你从事一些与公司不相干的个人交易，它仍然要求我们避免所有产生或者可能会产生利益冲突的事情发生。<br><br>
此外，还希望你全身心投入工作，不从事任何妨碍本职工作或所承担的责任或有违公司利益的活动。<br><br>

一般而言，你可以从事与公司业务无关的外部商业活动，只要这些商业活动：<br><br>
不涉及利益冲突；<br><br>
不干扰本人正常履行工作职责；<br><br>
不设法利用公司的影响、资源和设施；<br><br>
不玷污公司的名声。<br><br>
如果你不能确定你的利益与公司利益是否有冲突或可能有冲突，公司希望你为此向部门经理或人力资源部经理进行咨询。<br><br>
You may not engage in any conduct that poses a conflict of interest with the company's business. A prohibited conflict of interest exists where your interests conflict with or may appear to conflict with, the interests of the company.<br><br>
Although this duty does not prevent you from engaging in personal transactions that are not company-related, it does demand that you avoid situations where a conflict of interest might occur or appear to occur.<br><br>
You may generally engage in outside activities that are not related to the Company, if they:<br><br>
Do not involve a conflict of interest;<br><br>
Do not interfere with the performance of your Company responsibilities;<br><br>
Do not call for the use of the Company's influence, resources or facilities;<br><br>
Do not discredit the name or reputation of the Company.<br><br>

You are encouraged to seek guidance from the Department Manager or Human Resource Manager if you are unsure about whether your interests conflict with or appear to conflict with those of the Company.<br><br>
6.2.2 兼职 <br><br>
Outsides Boards<br><br>
事先未经公司营运总监明确的书面批准，你不得在捷普在职期间同时受雇于其供应商、客户或公司的竞争对手，尤其是当你受雇于公司的竞争对手（或未来很可能成为公司竞争对手）并成为其董事会的一员时，就与公司利益相冲突。<br><br>
本规定并非有意阻挠员工兼职，而是来帮助员工如何避免利益冲突。<br><br>
You may not serve on the board of a supplier, customer or competitor of the Company when you at the same time serve in Jabil unless you obtain prior and express written approval from the Director of Operations. In particular, it is a conflict of interest to serve as a board member of any company that competes (or is likely to compete in the future) with the Company. This policy is not intended to prevent service on such boards, but is intended to help you avoid conflicts of interest.<br><br>
6.2.3 私人企业 <br><br>
Outside Employment<br><br>
事先未经公司营运总监明确的书面批准，不得同时受雇于供应商、客户或公司的竞争对手。不得经营自己的生意与公司竞争或承接公司业务，譬如成为供应商、分销商或咨询顾问等。<br><br>
You may not accept simultaneous employment with a supplier, customer or competitor of the Company unless you obtain prior and express written approval of the Director of Operations. You may not engage in any self-employment that is in competition with the Company or contract with the Company as a supplier, distributor, or consultant.<br><br>
6.2.4 旅行、礼品、招待与回扣<br><br>
Travel, Gifts, Entertainment and Kickbacks<br><br>
有关旅行、礼品、招待与回扣的行为及活动应当严格遵循捷普的《关于海外反腐败条例、英国腐败法案和反腐败政策和指引》以及捷
普的《全球旅行和招待政策》。公司严禁收受任何形式的回扣。<br><br>
Activities and behaviors relating to travel, gifts and entertainment shall subject to the Jabil's ”Foreign Corruption Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and Anti-corruption Corporate Policy and Guidance” and Jabil's ”Global Travel and Entertainment Policy”. Kickbacks are strictly prohibited by the Company.<br><br>
6.2.5 公司以外的金融权益和投资<br><br>
Outside Commercial Interests and Investments<br><br>
在任何外界场合下，事先未经公司营运总监明确的书面批准，员工不得持有任何与公司利益会产生冲突的金融权益，诸如：股票、债券，取得任何直接的财务关系，这些会引起员工在履行职责时与公司之间产生利益冲突。<br><br>



不适当的金融利益和财务交易如下：<br><br>
竞争对手、供应商或客户的物料股权或其他投资。<br><br>
租售给公司的财产或资产利息收益。<br><br>
仅允许持有上市公司1％以内或私人企业5％以内的股份，因为在这种情况下很少产生利益冲突。此外，你可以从与公司有合作关系的金融机构处贷款，前提是执行标准的贷款条件，与不相干的第三方可以获得的贷款条件相当近似，而贷款也是按照此类金融机构通常承诺的标准方式予以发放的。如果你对一些不当的金融权益或交易心存疑问，请向部门经理或人力资源部经理咨询。<br><br>
You may not hold any financial interest, including stock or bond ownership or any other direct financial relationship, in any outside concern that creates a conflict of interest with your responsibilities to the Company unless you obtain the prior and express written approval of the Director of Operations. Examples of potentially inappropriate financial interests or transactions are:<br><br>
Material stock holdings or other investments in a competitor, supplier or a customer of the Company.<br><br>
Any material interest in property or assets which are sold or leased to the Company.<br><br>
You may own less than 1% of the stock of a public corporation, or 5% of the stock of a private corporation, because a conflict of interest rarely exists in those situations.<br><br>
Additionally, you may borrow from a financial institution that does business with the Company so long as the financial institution applies its normal underwriting standards and the terms of the loans are substantially similar to those the terms offered by the financial institutions to other third parties.<br><br>
6.2.6 关联方 <br><br>
RELATED PARTIES<br><br>
不得与亲戚或与有亲戚任高级管理职位的公司进行交易。这种类型的交易称作”关联方交易”。<br><br>
如果与这样的关联方进行交易不可避免，则必须把对方的性质如实告诉公司营运总监。若营运总监认为关系重大，那么在交易前必须由公司的审计委员进行审核和书面批准。此外，与关联方进行交易时只能以正常的方式进行，不许向其提供优待。<br><br>
You may not conduct Company business with a relative or with a business in which a relative holds a senior management role. This type of activity is referred to as a ”related party transaction”.<br><br>
If a related party transaction is unavoidable, you must fully disclose the nature of the relative party transaction to the Director of Operations. If the Director of Operations determines that the related party transaction is material to the Company, then the Company's Audit Committee must give prior and express written approval. In addition, the related party transaction must be conducted in a manner that does not provide the related party with preferential treatment.
<br><br>
6.2.7 公司里的机会 <br><br>
Corporate Opportunities<br><br>
不得利用公司的资产、信息或职务之便寻求机会谋取私利。<br><br>
You may not exploit for your own personal gain opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or your position with the Company.<br><br>
6.2.8 其它情况 <br><br>
Other Situations<br><br>
试图逐一列举所有可能产生利益冲突的情况是不切实际的。如果你对上述交易或情况产生疑问，请向人力资源部咨询。<br><br>
It would be impractical to attempt to list all possible situations where a conflict of interest may arise. If a proposed transaction or situation raises any questions or doubts in your mind, you should consult the Human Resource Department.<br><br>
6.3 捷普电子的经营标准<br><br>
Conducting Jabil’s Business in Compliance with Laws<br><br>
公司的商业道德准则包括业务经营所在国家的法规。公司商业特性及范畴决定了我们不可能对所有涉及我们职责或功能的方方面面作出要求。然而，公司仍希望员工知道和工作有关的基本法规及禁止行为，并要参加公司为此而开展的有关培训。<br><br>
本商业行为与道德准则以及地方法规勾勒出同我们工作有关的某些法规要求。如果你没有地方法规副本，你有义务联系人力资源部从而得到一份。<br><br>
The Company's business ethics and standards include compliance with the laws of the countries in which we operate.
Due to the nature and scope of the Company's business, it would impractical to cover all of the requirements that may apply to your respective function or location. However, you are expected to have a basic working knowledge of the applicable laws and prohibited activities related to your work for the Company. You are also required to participate in training when the Company offers it on these subjects.<br><br>
Certain of the legal requirements are outlined in this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and in the Local Rules. If you do not have a copy of the Local Rules, it is your responsibility to obtain a copy from your local HR contact.<br><br>
6.3.1 反垄断法 <br><br>
Antitrust Laws<br><br>
绝大多数国家有反托拉斯法或竞争法用来鼓励和保护公平自由的竞争。<br><br>
竞争法涉及到众多的商业行为，其中包括：与竞争对手协调行动（共同参加行业协会或行业标准设立机构、合资或合作等），操纵价格行为（如限价、价格歧视、掠夺性出价、秘密折扣等），销售限制条件，限制转售，促销打折，纵向限制公司供应商和采购商价格，与竞争对手并购等。无论当地法律是否禁止，有些行为是绝对不允许存在的,包括:以任何形式限定价格、与竞争对手协同分割或分配市场（包括协同不在某地理区域或产品区域竞争的做法），或者协同将其它对手排除出市场的做法。<br><br>
有些限价行为乍一看似乎不符合限价的定义，比如：竞争对手间共享产品或服务的价格结构或定价方法以及可能影响价格的商业条款等信息（例如：付款条件、削价和担保条款），透露请求参与投标者的身份及参与拍卖流程，这些都违反了竞争法。最后，与竞争对手合作试图维持价格或市场份额，即使没有签定有关具体价格的正式协议。这种做法也是不能接受的，竞争法还禁止企业发表描述竞争对手及其服务的错误或误导性言论，或误导他人对竞争对手及其服务的看法。包括美国（以及其它一些国家）在内的竞争法的适用对象不仅包括其本土所生产的产品，还包括在其本土所销售的产品。<br><br>
由于特定情况下如何应用竞争法是非常复杂的事，你碰到这类情况，无论何时产生疑问，无论何时建议与竞争对手签约或达成某项安排，无论何时认为出现例外情况，需与某竞争对手就价格或市场谈判，都要尽早找公司的法律顾问咨询。<br><br>
Most countries have antitrust or competition laws that are designed to encourage and protect free and fair competition.<br><br>
Competition laws generally address a wide range of practices, including: arrangements with competitors such as participating in trade association or in a standards-creation body, as well as joint ventures or other collaborations; pricing practices such as price fixing, price discrimination, predatory pricing and secret rebates; terms of sale; restrictions on resellers; promotional allowances; vertical restrictions with suppliers or purchasers of Company products; mergers or acquisitions of competitors; and many other practices. Certain activities may be prohibited by the Company, whether or not local low prohibits them. These activities include price-fixing in any form, bid rigging and arrangements with competitors to divide or allocate markets or customers (including arrangements not to compete in certain geographic or product areas) or arrangements to exclude others from a market.<br><br>

Price fixing covers behavior that may at first not seem to fit the definition. For example, it would be a violation of competition laws for competitors to share information about pricing or pricing methodology for goods or services as well as any commercial terms that impact price (such as payment, price reductions and warranty terms); disclosing the identity of bidders responding to requests for quotes or participating in auction processes. Finally, cooperating with competitors in an attempt to maintain prices or market shares is also unacceptable, even if there is not a formal agreement as to a particular price.<br><br>
Competition laws may also prohibit false or misleading statements regarding the Company's competitors or their services. Competition laws in the U.S. (and in some other countries) apply not only to products manufactured there but also to products sold there.<br><br>
Since the applications of the competition laws to particular situations is complex you should engage the Company's Legal Department as soon as a question arises in this area or whenever you are aware that the Company is proposing to enter into an agreement or arrangement with a competitor, or if you believe that an exceptional circumstance may require discussion of pricing or markets with any competitor. <br><br>


6.3.2 工业间谍行为 <br><br>
Industrial Espionage<br><br>
不得窃取或非法使用包括供应商、客户、商业合作伙伴或竞争对手在内的任何人的资料、物料、产品、知识产权、专有或保密资料。<br><br>
You may not steal or unlawfully use the information, material, products, intellectual property, or proprietary or confidential information of anyone, including the Company's suppliers, customers, business partners or competitors.<br><br>
6.3.3 广告宣传 <br><br>
Advertising<br><br>
公司诚实正直的声誉是一项宝贵的资产。通过良好的商业行为准则, 诸如,在宣传推广活动中始终保持坦诚，公司赢得了声誉。因此，不得在任何时刻在广告或宣传公司或促销公司产品及服务活动中进行名不副实的介绍。<br><br>
The Company's reputation for integrity is an important asset. We have developed our reputation through the conduct of our business, including our commitment to always be truthful in our promotional efforts.<br><br>
6.3.4 雇佣法与劳动 <br><br>
Employment and Labor Laws<br><br>
公司承诺为雇员提供安全合格的工作环境。公司的政策是遵守所有现行的雇佣和劳动法律法规，包括：<br><br>
遵守所有无歧视性规定<br><br>
维护使员工免受任何身体、性、心理、口头或视觉上的骚扰和虐待的环境<br><br>
遵守所有现行的对于最长工作时间的限制，员工工作时间符合法定要求<br><br>

Ensuring that no forced labor, indentured labor, or bonded labor is used;<br><br>
Offering a safety and health program that conforms to the best practices of organizations of our type, to reduce the number of occupational injuries and illnesses to a minimum.<br><br>
6.3.5 环境法 <br><br>
Environmental Laws<br><br>
我们承诺遵守现行的全部环境保护法律和法规，提供安全健康的工作场所，保护环境，节约能源和自然资源，采取适当的管理方法和技术防止环境污染。<br><br>
公司运营要求在制造过程中与使用、储存、运卸和处置危险化学品相关的一定数量的规定要求。公司也要求遵循确定的危险物品品种规定。公司监控遵循这些法律以维护公司作为一个有责任心的公司实体形象。并且，公司定期审核自己的做法和流程，以适应不断变化的环境，连续改善工作绩效。<br><br>
The Company is committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and providing a safe and healthy workplace, protecting the environment, conserving energy and natural resources, and preventing pollution by applying appropriate management practices and technology.<br><br>
The Company's operations are subject to a number of regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during the manufacturing processes. The company is also required to comply with certain hazardous substance content regulations.<br><br>
We monitor our compliance with these laws to maintain our status as a responsible corporate citizen in all locations in which we operate. In addition, we review our practices and procedures regularly to address changing circumstances, and to continually improve our performance.<br><br>
6.3.6 知识产权 <br><br>
Intellectual Property Rights<br><br>
总述<br><br>
知识产权包括专利、商标、版权、商业秘密以及其他任何通过知识性创造产生的个人的无形资产。知识产权所有者通常花费大量时间和金钱用于创造、完善和加强其知识产权，并以这些知识产权作为珍贵财产。知识产权可以表现为多种形式，包括：关于某一公司产品发展计划的口头陈述、客户或员工的名录、所有权设计、或在新产品发布会上的信息披露、软件资源代码等会因版权或专利而得到保护。<br><br>
公司及其客户、供应商和其他发生业务关系的第三方大量投资于知识产权。我们的政策是尊重第三方的知识产权，以及在认为必要时维护自己的知识产权。公司员工应该对现行的知识产权法和与工作相关的禁止性规定有基本的了解。并且，在使用知识产权时必须遵循可能包含于公司与第三方签订的契约中的限制条款。<br><br>
不当的使用或披露他人的知识产权会使公司陷入巨额债务并将严重伤害公司的声誉，以及破坏公司和第三方的关系。<br><br>
General<br><br>
Intellectual property includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and any other intangible personal property that is created through the intellectual efforts of its creator.<br><br>
Intellectual property owners generally expend considerable time and money to create, perfect and enforce intellectual property rights and as a result, generally consider those rights to be valuable assets. Intellectual property may take many forms. For example, intellectual property may include:<br><br>
an oral presentation about a company's product development plans; a customer or employee list; a proprietary design; or information disclosed during a new product demonstration.<br><br>
Software source code may be protected by copyright or patents.<br><br>
The Company and its customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business have made substantial investments in intellectual property rights. It is our policy to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and to enforce our rights when we believe it is necessary to do so.<br><br>
You are expected to have a basic working knowledge of the applicable intellectual property laws and prohibited activities related to your work for the Company. In addition, you must comply with the restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights that may be included in the Company.s contracts with third parties.<br><br>
You improper use or disclosure of intellectual property of others can subject the Company to significant liability and can seriously harm our reputation and relationships with third parties.<br><br>
前任雇主 <br><br> 
Former Employers<br><br>

公司员工可能曾经受雇于其它同类相似行业，并拥有前任雇主的商业秘密。这些员工不得向公司透露可被前雇主合理地当作商业秘密的信息资料。如果有这方面的问题，应该向人力资源部咨询。<br><br>
If you are a former employee of another company that is engaged in a similar line of business, you may be in possession of trade secrets of your former employer. Please consult the Human Resource Department if you have any questions or concerns about whether you have disclosed any trade secrets of your former employer to the Company.<br><br>
其他硬件版权资料 <br><br>
Other Hardcopy Copyrighted Material<br><br>

You may not scan or copy any hardcopy copyrighted material by any third party for use in your services for the Company unless you first obtain written permission from the copyright holder prior to the proposed use.<br><br>
6.3.7 保密信息 <br><br>
Confidential Information<br><br>
保密信息是指经捷普公司或其客户、供应商或其他第三方加工处理之信息， ”需要知道”的个人以用于某一特定的商业目的。保密信息包括：想法、设计、工程和制造工艺、图表、公式和流程。也可以包含商业和战略计划、资金花费计划、定价数据、采购计划、财务信息、员工记录、客户清单、制造工艺、客户或供应商清单及报价、新的想法、商业秘密、发明和应用专利。保密信息可以采用硬件、软件或诸如电子邮件等电子沟通方式，这些信息可能标注或不标注”保密”字样。<br><br>

To promote Company's business, from time to time our confidential information may be disclosed to potential business partners. However, such disclosure should never be done without carefully considering its potential benefits and risks. If you determine, in consultation with your manager and other appropriate Company management, that disclosure of confidential information is necessary, you must also contact the company's legal adviser, that disclosure of confidential information is necessary, you must then ensure that an appropriate written nondisclosure agreement is signed prior to the disclosure. Significant deviations from the provisions of the Company's standard nondisclosure
agreement should be discussed with a member of the Company's Legal Department.<br><br>
保密协议的需求 <br><br>
Need for Nondisclosure Agreement<br><br>
除非签署适当的保密协议，永远不要接受第三方提供的已标明保密的信息或可以基于其内容、上下文或环境合理判断为保密的信息。即便存在保密协议，你也需仅仅接受出于完成既定目的之信息即可，――如对于是否继续某项谈判进程的决定。<br><br>
You should never accept information offered by a third party that they indicate is confidential, or which you should reasonable assume is confidential based on the content, context or circumstances under which it is disclosed to you, unless an appropriate nondisclosure agreement has been signed with the party offering the information. Even after a nondisclosure agreement is in place, you should accept only the information necessary to accomplish the purpose of
receiving it, such as a decision on whether to proceed to negotiate a deal.<br><br>
竞争者信息<br><br>
Competitive Information<br><br>
永远不要试图通过非正当手段及特意接触竞争者以获得其保密信息。<br><br>

Obligations under U.S. Securities Laws<br><br>

公司承诺定期根据法律法规的要求向投资公众提供透明、连续和可信的信息。公司员工不得向公司外的任何人有选择性地泄漏资料及非公开信息，―――除非是对公司存有信任义务的顾问和代表（即：我们的独立会计师、律师和投资银行）以及与公司签有保密协议的人（只要泄漏的内容在保密协议的范围之内），或在本政策与美国证券交易委员会规定制定的公正披露规定许可范围内。<br><br>

社交媒体准则<br><br>
Social Media Policy<br><br>
捷普电子有限公司（下文称为”捷普”） 了解很多员工拥有个人博客或在其它在线聊天或社交网站上发帖。<br><br>
本《社交媒体准则》的目的在于帮助捷普管理社交网络活动，以免社交网络活动对捷普的员工、客户、供应商、销售商、投资者或任何与捷普有业务往来的第三方产生影响。在本准则中，”社交网络活动”包括在互联网上发布的所有类型的帖子，包括但不限于，社交网站（例如FaceBook 、MySpace 或LinkedIn ）；博客及其它在线日志或日记；论坛，例如百度和聊天室；微博，例如Twitter ; 以及在YouTube 和类似媒体网站上发布的视频。社交网络活动还包括当某一员工具有管理发帖内容权限时允许或不删除他人在个人资料、博客等页面上的帖子。<br><br>
本准则适用于捷普所有员工的社交网络活动，包括员工在上班或下班时使用捷普或个人电子设备（包括但不限于桌面电脑、笔记本电脑以及手机）进行的社交网络活动，以及不论该员工以匿名或使用网名的形式在网上发帖。没有捷普出具的书面授权，任何员工无权以捷普的名义进行社交网络活动。<br><br>
进行社交网络活动时，员工应密切关注自己的发帖，即使员工不在公司上网且在下班时间进行相关活动，仍有可能损害捷普的合法商业利益。为避免此类风险，特此实施以下准则对社交网络活动进行管理。<br><br>
不要使用任何能辨别出您是捷普员工的电子邮件帐户、用户名或照片。您的社交网络活动受保密协议、员工手册、《捷普行为规范》以及捷普的其它政策约束。这意味着您不能发布任何与捷普、捷普的客户、供应商或销售商有关以及与其有协议规定的商业秘密、专利信息或保密信息。如果您有任何疑问，请在发帖前咨询企业传讯部，以免受到纪律处分或解聘等处罚。<br><br>
严禁诽谤或中伤捷普的服务或捷普的客户、销售商、供应商或竞争对手提供的产品或服务。没有捷普的事先批准，严禁提及捷普客户、销售商、供应商或竞争对手的名称。这样做可能会违反捷普已经与客户、销售商、供应商或竞争对手达成的保密条款。<br><br>

严禁冒充捷普的客户、销售商、供应商、同事或竞争对手。<br><br>
严禁发布捷普的企业标识、商标或专利图片或其它可能涉及捷普的经营场所、工厂、工艺、运作、客户产品、客户设计或相关数据的图片或视频。例如，发布在捷普厂房内使用手机或其它照相设备拍摄的相片即为违反本准则的规定。<br><br>
严禁在没有获得客户、供应商、销售商、同事或主管事先许可的情况下透露其个人信息或联系方式。<br><br>
捷普有独立及绝对的自主决定权，在其认为必要或合理的范围内，以确保遵守相关安全规定或其它法规为目的，要求您暂时仅限在与捷普无关的方面进行社交网络活动。<br><br>
捷普有独立及绝对的自主决定权，要求您移除任何社交网络站点上不符合本准则的内容。<br><br>
如收到任何要求提供证明或进行推荐的请求，包括从社交网络上收到的相关请求，必须立刻转发至人力资源部门，由其根据捷普的相关政策采取相应的措施。<br><br>
如媒体或新闻人士就您进行的社交网络活动与您联系，请在回应前咨询企业传讯部。<br><br>

捷普投入了大量的时间与资源来建立其声誉与商誉。这些是珍贵而重要的公司财产。当您在进行社交网络活动时表明自己为捷普员工或与捷普有关时，请想一想您的行为是否会损害捷普的声誉。如果您不确定会产生怎样的后果，您应在发帖前咨询企业传讯部，以免受到纪律处分或解聘等处罚。<br><br>
当您有任何意见，与在网上发帖诉苦相比，直接与您的同事、主管或其它管理层人员沟通更有可能解决您的问题。请通过可用的内部资源而不是社交网络活动来解决这些类型的问题。<br><br>
经理不应在上下班时在Twitter上”跟进”或向下属发送”好友”请求。任何员工可拒绝任何其他员工的好友请求而不会产生任何影响。虽然您不是捷普的官方在线发言人，但是您是捷普通向社交媒体领域的重要渠道。如果您在网络上看到您认为是重要的、有关捷普的正面或负面评论，请转发到企业传讯部。<br><br>
实施<br><br>
捷普将有权自行决定在相关法律允许的最大范围内审查您的社交网络活动。在符合相关法律的前提下，员工在使用捷普提供的财产时不享有隐私权或有限的隐私权。如果您以匿名的方式或使用网名进行社交网络活动，请注意在某些情形下捷普会在相关法律允许的范围内采取措施确定您的身份。<br><br>
违反本准则可能会导致纪律处分直至并包括解聘等处罚。在某些情形下，捷普将采取所有有效的合法补救措施。捷普还会向相应的执法部门报告可能存在的违法行为。捷普不会以干扰或限制员工合法权利的方式诠释或执行本准则。<br><br>

Jabil Circuit, Inc. (”Jabil”) recognizes that many employees have personal blogs or contribute to other onlineconversations and social networking sites.<br><br> 
This Social Media Policy helps Jabil regulate social networking when it impacts Jabil's employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, investors or other third parties who deal with Jabil.<br><br>
”Social networking,” for purposes of this policy, includes all types of postings on the Internet, including, but not limited to, social networking sites, (such as Facebook , MySpace  or LinkedIn ); blogs and other on-line journals and diaries; bulletin boards, such as Baidu and chat rooms; microblogging, such as Twitter ; and the posting of video on YouTube  and similar media. Social networking also includes permitting or not removing postings by others where an employee can control the content of postings, such as on a personal profile or blog.<br><br>
This Policy applies to social networking by all employees of Jabil. It includes social networking while on or off duty, while using Jabil's or personal electronic resources (including but not limited to computers, laptops and cell phones), and whether or not the employee posts anonymously or using a pseudonym. No employee is authorized to engage in social networking on Jabil's behalf without express written authorization.<br><br>
Employees who engage in social networking should be mindful that their postings, even if done off premises and while off duty, could have an adverse affect on Jabil's  legitimate business interests. To reduce that risk, the following policies apply to your social networking:<br><br>
Do not use any e-mail account, user name or photograph that identifies you as a Jabil employee.<br><br>
Your social networking is subject to the terms of your nondisclosure agreement, employee handbook, the Jabil Code
of Conduct and all of Jabil's policies. This means you cannot post any trade secrets and proprietary or confidential information of and agreements in place with Jabil or Jabil's customers, suppliers and vendors. If you are uncertain, you should consult Corporate Communications before posting to avoid possible disciplinary action or termination
Do not defame or otherwise discredit Jabil's services, or the products or services of its customers, vendors, suppliers, or competitors. Do not identify customers, vendors, suppliers, or competitors by name without prior approval from Jabil. To do so may violate confidentiality terms in place with such customers, vendors, suppliers, or competitors. <br><br>
Do not impersonate Jabil customers, vendors, suppliers, coworkers or competitors.<br><br>
Do not post Jabil's logo, trademark or proprietary graphics, or photographs or video of Jabil's premises, plants, processes, operations, customer products, customer designs, or data.<br><br>
For example, it is a violation of this Policy to post any pictures taken with a cell phone or other camera device of the interior of a Jabil plant.<br><br>
Do not disclose personal or contact information or post photographs or video of customers, suppliers, vendors, coworkers or supervisors without their prior permission.<br><br>
Jabil may request, in its sole and absolute discretion, that you temporarily confine your social networking to matters unrelated to Jabil if Jabil determines this is necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with securities regulations or other laws.<br><br>
Jabil may request, in its sole and absolute discretion, that you remove any contents in any social networking sites which are inconsistent with this policy.<br><br>
All requests for references or recommendations, even those that are received through social networking, must be directed promptly to the Human Resources Department, who will handle the request in accordance with Jabil's policies in place. <br><br>
If someone from the media or press contacts you about your social networking activities, speak to Corporate Communications before responding. Jabil also asks that you observe the following guidelines whenever your social networking identifies you as a Jabil employee or relates in any way to Jabil's business, employees, customers, vendors, suppliers, or competitors:<br><br>


Jabil has spent substantial time and resources building its reputation and good will. These are valuable and important corporate assets. When you engage in social networking that identifies yourself as an employee of the Jabil, or that relates to Jabil, please consider whether you are damaging Jabil's reputation. If you are uncertain, you should consult Corporate Communications before posting to avoid possible disciplinary action or termination.<br><br>

You are more likely to resolve complaints about work by speaking directly with your co-workers, supervisor or other
management-level personnel than by posting complaints on the Internet. Please consider using available internal
resources, rather than social networking, to resolve these types of complaints.<br><br>
Managers should not ”follow” on Twitter or send ”friend” requests to subordinates while on or off duty. Any employee
may reject a friend request from any other employee without repercussion.<br><br>
Even if you are not an official online spokesperson for Jabil, you are an important link to the social media landscape. If you come across positive or negative remarks about Jabil online that you believe are important, please consider sharing them by forwarding them to Corporate Communications.<br><br>
Enforcement
Jabil will, in its discretion, review your social networking activities to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law There is no right and/or limited right of privacy by Jabil employees in their use of Jabil provided property, subject to applicable law. If you engage in social networking anonymously or using a pseudonym, you should be aware that in appropriate circumstances and subject to applicable law, Jabil will take steps to determine your identity.<br><br>

Failure to comply with this policy may lead to discipline up to and including termination. In appropriate circumstances, Jabil will pursue all available legal remedies. Jabil also may report suspected unlawful conduct to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Jabil will not construe or apply this policy in a manner that interferes with or limits employees' rights under any applicable law.<br><br>
If you need clarification of any aspect of this policy, please contact Corporate Communications.<br><br>
By reading and signing this policy, you hereby unconditionally agree to abide by its terms and conditions.
